# Apple Chicken Stew

## Rating
8/10
maybe a touch too sweet. Use less apples (one) or use tartier apples (granny smith) next time

## Ingredients

- Any frying fat
- Chicken thigs, boneless, 1kg
- 2 Onions
- 3 gloves of garlic
- Apple Cider, 300 mL, Bilpin
- Coconut Cream, 400 mL
- 2 Potatoes
- 2 Apples
- Pepper
- 2 scoops of mustard
- bayleaves

## Make

Heat the pot, add frying fat (coconut oil or butter). Give chicken a browning, remove chicken.

Chop onions into strips, fry until brown.

Add the cider to the onions, boil for 2 minutes. Then add the coconut cream. Bring temperature back up to simmer, add the chicken back. Cut apple and potatoes into pieces, add to stew. Might need a little water now so that everything is covered.

Add bayleaves, pepper and 2 scoops of mustard.

Cook for at least 3 hours.
