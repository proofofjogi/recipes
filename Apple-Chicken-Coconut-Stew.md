## Make

Heat the pot, add frying fat (coconut oil or butter). Give chicken a browning, remove chicken.

Chop onions into strips, fry until brown.

Add the cider to the onions, boil for 2 minutes. Then add the coconut cream. Bring temperature back up to simmer, add the chicken back. Cut apple and potatoes into pieces, add to stew. Might need a little water now so that everything is covered.

Add bayleaves, pepper and 2 scoops of mustard.

Cook for at least 3 hours.
