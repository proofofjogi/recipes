## Rating
10/10

## Ingredients

- Smoked Bacon 250g
- Beef 1 kg
- Pinot Noir Red Wine (700 mL)
- Three large onions
- One large carrot
- Three Garlic gloves
- Fresh thyme
- Fresh parsley

## Make

Chop:
  beef into 1 inch cubes
  bacon into small dice
  onions into strips
  carrots into chunks

All in one big pot. Never change pots.

Brown the smoked bacon in a pan without any extra fat. The bacon will release fat by itself.

Remove bacon when brown, set aside for later.

Brown the beef in the left-over bacon fat. Set aside for later.

Fry onions until golden brown in the left-over bacon fat.

When onions are golden brown, dump all of the wine onto the onions. Enjoy the smell while you bring the wine up to a slow boil.

Add the beef and bacon back. Also add spices now (garlic, thyme, parsley). Cook on very low for very long. 3-4 hours.

1 hour before eating, add the carrots to the pot.
